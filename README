#OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer with compiler ports

This layer aims at porting some old compilers to newer Yocto release.

## Why?

Because sometimes an old compiler is required, but you still want to use more updated recipes and OE system
than the ones shipped with the release which supports your compiler.

## Status

Currently the ports have been tested against the "rocko" branch of Poky.

## Dependencies

This layer depends on:
URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: rocko
